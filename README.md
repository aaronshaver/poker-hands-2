# poker-hands-2

models deck of cards, deals ~800K hands/sec, evaluates hands, records stats

## Requirements

* Other than JUnit 4, there's nothing but standard libraries used
* Written against Java 17, chosen because, at the time I wrote this program, it was the latest LTS (long-term support) release so I figured it would have the best compatibility

## Usage

On commandline, supply an integer for number of hands you'd like to deal as your first and only argument

In an IDE like IntelliJ, run the main() method of the Main class
